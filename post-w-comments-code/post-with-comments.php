            <b>Margaret says:</b>
            <p>The argument is not just a libertarian one but also a liberal question of justice and the affect on minorities of a draconian law that puts people in prison for society to pay for, when its use is not worse than taking a drink. This is injustice and very expensive to us as a society, both in money and in lost lives.</p>

            <b>Joe says:</b>
            <p>I'm a cool dude, but I do not think marijuana should be legalized. Of the 10 or more friends I see on a consistent basis that also smoke pot, 4 of them, including myself, have had severe panic attacks that was the initial event that prompted the use of anti-anxiety medicine or counseling. Marijuana causes extreme anxiety in some, and I hope no experimenter ever has to experience a massive weed panic attack like me or my friends did. Legalization of alcohol is enough, weed should not be added to that list. </p>

            <p>The continued reference to marijuana as a "drug" seems to imply that some of the old hysteria and mistaken focus remains. Dangerous and "hard" drugs are another matter, but we now know that marijuana is not in that category. </p>

            <b>davisonnj says:</b>
            <p>The advantages to keeping marijuana illegal include a jammed up legal system that incarcerates innocent people at huge expense to taxpayers, loss of millions of dollars of revenue along with potential jobs in a new industry and channeling the public toward much more harmful alcohol and drugs. Makes perfect sense to me. </p>

            <p>Can't OD on pot? Ever watch a pot head floating down the street in a foggy haze? Nice. Do people over the age of 18 still think this is cool? Sad. Watching 50-year olds passing around a joint is laughable if it weren't so pathetic. Aside from the benefits attained by legitimately and seriously ill people, smoking pot is stupid. When one grows up, one is supposed to put away childish things. </p>

            <p>As the evidence clearly shows benefits of legalization include reduced traffic fatalities and a drop in violent crime. There are also the obvious benefits like reducing funding for terrorists, gangs, and cartels. I have to ask those who are opposed why they love terrorists and drug cartels. </p>

            <p>I get real nervous when folks say, "its good for you". No, its not good for me, thank you, I dont want to smell it, I dont want to breathe it, I dont want your drugs near me. Ive observed that the internal experience is all thats important for people who get high. When theyre high nothing around them seems to matter--that means my rights as a non user. I vote no to protect myself from this mindless assault. </p>
