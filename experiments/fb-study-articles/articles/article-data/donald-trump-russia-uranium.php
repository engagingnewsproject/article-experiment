$article = '<p>As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013 a flow of cash made its way to the Trump Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by Trump, despite an agreement Mr. Trump had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors.</p>

<p>And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Trump received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.</p>

<p>To recap: Donald Trump approved a deal that handed over 20% of all uranium production capacity in the United States to the Russian state, while at the same time Trump’s personal interests received close to $3 million from Moscow and the chairman of Uranium One.</p>';
