$article = '<p>Two baseball players at the University of Richmond in Virginia are among five who have been suspended because they violated NCAA rules by playing fantasy football.</p>

<p>The five players remain suspended as the school waits for the NCAA to address their status. Two sources told the Times-Dispatch they were involved in fantasy football, an NCAA rules violation. The players’ fantasy football activity was reported directly to the NCAA, the sources said.</p>

<p>NCAA rules state: “You are not eligible to compete if you knowingly participate in any sports wagering activity that involves intercollegiate, amateur or professional athletics, through a bookmaker, a parlay card or any other method employed by organized gambling. Examples of sports wagering include, but are not limited to, the use of a bookmaker or parlay card; Internet sports wagering; auctions in which bids are placed on teams, individuals or contests; and pools or fantasy leagues in which an entry fee is required.”</p>';
