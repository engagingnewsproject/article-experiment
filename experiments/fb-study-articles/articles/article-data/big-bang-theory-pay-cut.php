$article = '<p>The Big Bang Theory&rsquo;s original cast members have reportedly taken pay cuts in order to get Melissa Rauch and Mayim Bialik raises ahead of the expected two-season renewal, according to Variety.</p>

<p>Jim Parsons, Johnny Galecki, Kaley Cuoco, Simon Helberg, and Kunal Nayyar reportedly made the gesture while Bialik and Rauch are still in the process of negotiating new contracts, with Variety reporting they’re seeking parity with their costars.</p>

<p>According to Variety, the original five stars, who currently earn around $1 million per episode, would make $100,000 less per episode in a potential 11th and 12th seasons. That $500,000 would be split between Rauch and Bialik, who are both currently in the $200,000 range, bringing their new per episode rate to around $450,000.</p>';
