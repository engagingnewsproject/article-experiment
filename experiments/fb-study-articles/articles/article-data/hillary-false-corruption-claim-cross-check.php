$article = '<p>A News Beat article circulating on Facebook falsely claims that Hillary Clinton “handed over American uranium rights to the Russians” as part of a “pay-to-play” scheme to get “filthy rich.” Clinton did not have the authority to approve that deal.</p>

<p>The article, titled “Corruption: Clinton’s Uranium for Donations Deal,” makes several shaky claims as it tries to link the income Bill and Hillary Clinton have earned since leaving political office with donations to the Clinton Foundation.</p>

<p>But the Clintons didn’t pocket money that was donated to the nonprofit Clinton Foundation, set up by Bill Clinton after his time as president. Instead, they made their money outside of office by giving speeches and writing books, according to a Fortune.com article.</p>

<h3>‘Handed Over’ Uranium?</h3>

<p>The News Beat article claims that Hillary Clinton “even handed over American uranium rights to the Russians,” citing an April 2015 New York Times story. But the story doesn’t say that. And the idea that Clinton could have “handed over” uranium rights, even if she wanted to, isn’t supported by the facts.</p>

<p>The Times story doesn’t find evidence of a pay-to-play scandal or say that Clinton was responsible for the uranium deal. It details how the Clinton Foundation had received millions in donations from investors in Uranium One, a Canadian-based company that sold a controlling stake in 2010 to Rosatom, the Russian nuclear energy agency, in a deal that had to be approved by the U.S. government. Uranium One had mining stakes in the Western United States, amounting to one-fifth of the uranium production capacity in the U.S., the Times reported.</p>

<p>The article doesn’t back up the claims that Clinton “cut deals for donors” or “sold out American workers.” And it’s simply false to claim she “handed over American uranium rights to the Russians.”</p>
