$article = '<p>As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013 a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium One’s chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well.</p>

<p>And shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock.</p>

</p>To recap: Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved a deal that handed over 20% of all uranium production capacity in the United States to the Russian state, while at the same time Clinton’s personal interests received close to $3 million from Moscow and the chairman of Uranium One.</p>';
