$article = '<p>You know that sharp odor of chlorine from the swimming pool you can recall from earliest childhood? It turns out it&rsquo;s not just chlorine, but a potent brew of chemicals that form when chlorine meets sweat, body oils, and urine.</p>

<p>But up until now, just how much urine has been difficult to measure, says chemist Xing-Fang Li of the University of Alberta. Li and her colleagues report they can now tell roughly how much pee is in a pool by measuring the artificial sweeteners carried in most people&rsquo;s urine. Certain sweeteners can be a good proxy for pee, she says, because they&rsquo;re designed to "go right through you" and don&rsquo;t break down readily in pool water.</p>

<p>The scientists calculated that one 220,000-gallon, commercial-size swimming pool contained almost 20 gallons of urine. It&rsquo;s only about one-hundredth of a percent, but any urine in a swimming pool can be a health concern for some people, not to mention that smell that never quite goes away.</p>

<p>Chlorine reacts with urine to form a host of potentially toxic compounds. These can include nitrosamines, which can cause cancer. There&rsquo;s not enough evidence to say whether the nitrosamine levels in pools increase cancer risk, Blatchley says, but one study in Spain did find more bladder cancers in some long-term swimmers.</p>

<p>The simplest solution: Just don&rsquo;t pee in the pool. And tell all your friends not to do it, either.</p>';
