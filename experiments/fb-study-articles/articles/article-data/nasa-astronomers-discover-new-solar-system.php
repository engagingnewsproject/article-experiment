$article = '<p>Life may have evolved on at least three planets within a newly discovered solar system that is 39 light years from Earth.</p>

<p>Astronomers at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have detected no less than seven roughly Earth-sized worlds orbiting a dwarf star in the system.</p>

<p>Scientists had previously only identified a tiny number of so-called “exoplanets”, which are believed to have the qualities needed to support life.</p>

<p>However, the new system contains an unprecedented number of Earth-sized, probably rocky planets, and is being hailed as an “accelerated leap forward” in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>

<p>Three of the new planets are said to be particularly promising because they could sustain oceans. Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator of NASA’s Science Mission Directorate, told a press conference in Washington: “This gives us a hint that finding a second Earth is not a matter of ‘if’, but ‘when’.”</p>';
