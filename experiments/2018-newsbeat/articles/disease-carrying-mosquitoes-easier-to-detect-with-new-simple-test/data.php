<p>Previously existing technology made testing mosquitoes for dangerous diseases expensive and time-consuming. However, researchers in Texas have developed a new diagnostic tool to easily identify whether a mosquito belongs to the species that carries diseases such the Zika virus, dengue, chikungunya or yellow fever.</p>

<p>“Many of these diseases are spreading in areas where they weren’t common before,” said Sanchita Bhadra, a research associate and first author on the paper. “Having surveillance is important in conjunction with any kind of outbreak, and this method allows a rapid test in the field.”</p>

<p>The new tool utilizes a smartphone camera, a small box and a simple chemical test to determine whether or not a dead mosquito belongs to the Aedes aegypti species, which carries Zika and various devastating diseases. The species has also been credited for the tripling of cases of mosquito-borne diseases in the U.S. since 2004.</p>

<p>With accuracy greater than 97 percent, the new diagnostic tool starkly contrasts previously existing diagnostic techniques. Before this development, technology required an expensive and complex process to extract nucleic acid from inside the mosquitoes. The new tool tests the mosquitoes’ nucleic acid without having to remove it, and can be used anywhere.</p>

<p>The tool developed by scientists can also detect Wolbachia, a bacteria that prevents mosquitoes from spreading diseases. In much of the United States and around the globe, scientists have been working with public health agencies to introduce Wolbachia into a local mosquito population in an effort to curb the transmission of viruses.</p>

<p>“This test can happen without involving a lot of staff and equipment to make sure Wolbachia is effective and spreading as anticipated,” Bhadra said.</p>';
