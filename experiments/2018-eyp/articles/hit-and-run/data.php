<p>Fairview police are asking for the community\'s assistance in locating the man whose vehicle is suspected of striking and seriously injuring a bicyclist Monday on the city\'s south side.</p>

<p>Investigators are looking for 20-year-old Justin Lopez in connection with the crash that seriously injured Fairview resident Tiffany Reese. A warrant for his arrest on a charge of leaving the scene of an accident causing serious bodily injury was issued Tuesday, police said.</p>

<p>Police say Reese was traveling south on Shelby Street near Central Avenue when she was struck by a silver SUV, also traveling south. The SUV driver then fled the scene, and the vehicle was found abandoned near the area of Madison Avenue and Bacon Street.</p>

<p>When first responders arrived, they found Reese bleeding and unconscious. She was transported by ambulance to Valley General Hospital, where she remains in the intensive care unit in critical condition.</p>

<p>Fairview resident Daran Waters, an eyewitness to the accident, attempted to chase down Lopezâ€™s vehicle before the driver bailed out of the car and ran on foot.</p>

<p>Anyone with information about the incident or Lopez\'s whereabouts should contact the Fairview Police Department at tips@fairviewpd.gov.</p>';
