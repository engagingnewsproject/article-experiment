$article = '<p>If you want to know where mass school shootings are most likely to occur, look no farther than small-town and suburban America.</p>

	<p>Of the 10 deadliest school shootings in the U.S., all but one took place in a town with fewer than 75,000 residents and the vast majority of them were in cities with fewer than 50,000 people, according to FBI records.</p>

<p>These are seemingly idyllic places to grow up: low crime rates, good schools and a sense of community where everyone seems to know your name. And it\'s exactly those attributes, experts say, that are why small rural and suburban towns are a breeding ground for the next school shooter.</p>

<p>"In small-town America, it\'s said everybody knows everybody, and that\'s well and good except when you don\'t want everybody to know what\'s going on with you," said James Alan Fox, a professor at Northeastern University who has been studying mass shootings for decades. "If things are going downhill for you, you did something wrong or someone did something wrong to you and some girl dumps you, everybody knows. So it\'s much harder to get away from it. Whereas in the big city, where no one knows your name, that can be a good thing."</p>

<p>Parkland, Florida, where authorities say a former student in February gunned down 17 people, had just recently been voted the safest town in Florida. Newtown, Connecticut, where a shooting in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary School took the lives of 20 children and six adults, is a classic New England town, seemingly a world away from the crime and problems of nearby Bridgeport, one of that state\'s largest cities.</p>

<p>The site of the Columbine High School tragedy in 1999 was a Denver suburb, the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007 happened in a college town of about 40,000 people. The Santa Fe High School shooting in May took place in a town of 13,000 people about 40 minutes southeast of Houston.</p>

<p>The prevalence of the mass shootings in smaller cities stands in contrast to the situation in big cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. They have strict gun laws and their own problems with street gun violence, but it\'s rare that a mass shooting has been carried out in one of their schools.</p>

<p>In the 1980s and 1990s, urban districts sought to make schools safer from drug- and gang-related violence, taking such steps as installing metal detectors at entrances. That is exactly what pro-gun Republicans and the National Rifle Association have been proposing in the wake of recent massacres.</p>

<p>A national poll by Rice University, released last month, found more than 60 percent of surveyed Republicans said they believed the country would be safer if more people – including teachers – carried guns. Only 5 percent of Democrats said they felt the same way.</p>

<p>“Republicans and Democrats tend to look at the same tragedy from very different perspectives,” said Mark Jones, a Rice University political scientist. “Democrats look at school shootings and their most popular answer tends to be that gun control is the correct response to keep this from happening in the future. Whereas Republicans don’t see it that way. They don’t believe gun control would have any impact.”</p>

<p>Yet, some school security and psychology experts, as well as organizations like Everytown for Gun Safety and the Brady Campaign, say school designs and talk of arming teachers is a simplistic approach that doesn\'t get at the heart of preventing it from happening. While students often have a sense that a classmate might be planning an attack or know that someone is troubled, the bigger issue is that troubled students still have access to guns and those who know them might be more hesitant in smaller towns to tell anyone about it.</p>

<p>"The best prevention is to catch them early before they show up with a gun rather than trying to make it hard for them once they\'re already at the building with a gun," Fox said.</p>';
