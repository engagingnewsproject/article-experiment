$article = '<p>Gun control advocates have called for laws raising the age for gun purchases to 21, but one report shows doing so would have little if any impact on mass shootings and other gun-related crimes. The Crime Prevention Research Center released a report looking into the age distribution of mass public shooters in America, with a particular emphasis on whether raising the age of those purchasing guns would have made any difference in recent mass shootings.</p>

<p>Center President John Lott Jr. concludes that it’s “misplaced” to raise the age limit for gun ownership to 21 if the motivation is to curb recent massacres. To back the study’s findings, Lott points to academic research, which he argues is completely ignored by gun control advocates.</p>

<p>“We are all looking for magic bullets to stop crime, but doing so creates real problems,” Lott told The News Beat. “For example, raising the age limit prevents a 20-year-old woman who is being stalked from purchasing a gun for her protection.”</p>

<p>His study’s findings also indicate that raising the age would not have prevented many of the most recent mass shootings. Over the last 20 years, 85 percent of the mass public shootings were committed by people over 21, and of those shooters under 21, half were already banned from purchasing guns.</p>';
