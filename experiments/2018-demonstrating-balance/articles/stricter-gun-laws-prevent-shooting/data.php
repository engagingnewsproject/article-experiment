<p>The National Rifle Association and other groups have opposed government-backed gun research for two decades, so Andrew Morgan, Rand’s lead researcher on the study, and his team had to frequently rely on estimates from experts.</p>

<p>“Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence indicates that more guns in a community leads to more injuries and deaths,” noted Morgan.</p>

<p>Specifically, the study found that child access prevention laws, which aim to keep guns out of kids’ hands, reduce injuries and suicides. Another finding was that “stand your ground” laws – which allow Americans to defend themselves with guns without first attempting to retreat from a confrontation – increase state homicide rates.</p>

<p>The study drew from policy researchers and affiliates of advocacy groups, such as Everytown for Gun Safety, the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation. These groups’ experts explained how much a given law might affect gun homicides, gun suicides, gun accidents and mass shooting deaths.</p>';
