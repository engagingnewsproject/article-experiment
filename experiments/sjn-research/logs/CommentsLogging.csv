problem|174.57.103.84|11/18/2015 8:37:16 AM|Brandi|It is refreshing to see an article that acknowledges the fact that Americans are indeed having issues with the current economy. There is almost a taboo air about mentioning the financial struggles people are inevitably are facing in today\&#39;s times. There is nothing to be ashamed about, it just means we all have to get back up and move forward. There\&#39;s no other way to go.

They didn\&#39;t raise rent for us.  I can now say we own our home. My kids our my world and I want to get them the main thing they ask for Christmas.  Now they only get the one thing and little miscellaneous things that don\&#39;t break the bank for us, and that I always use cash or money we have. And right now our 1 out of 2 vehicles is broken down also. Husband is working overtime so we can get another vehicle.

problem|70.192.145.137|12/09/2015 12:53:18 PM|Joe|It\&#39;s a tough world out there and that\&#39;s the problem our government has with helping people wiith these type of problems . Our government helps more people from or the country\&#39;s then helping the the people in there own back yard and these are the same people we elected on the promise that they would help these people out. Take the Obama health care . There are people out there that can\&#39;t afford that and then the almighty government wants to fine them for not having health care. It\&#39;s time for the government to worry about every person in this country before we help another person not from this country.

solution|100.7.79.182|12/10/2015 9:10:55 AM|Barb|The problem with this country is as Americans who were born and raised in this country cannot get loans for some reason or another and they work hard for they money and still cannot make ends meet. Then we have these foreigners come into our country and are able to get loans to set themselves up in a business with a loan interest. WHY?  Plus they come into our country and get food stamps and other things to help them get started. There are Americans who have had their jobs cut way back and lost there health insurance. Now they are not even eligible for this new health care insurance. WHY!

I have some savings now, but it is still very hard to grow any large amount of money.  Something always comes up to wipe out the savings.  The middle class is slowly being edged out.

solution|141.214.17.252|12/14/2015 9:03:41 AM|Debbie|I think payday loans are hard to get out of.  I hear so many people in a pinch get them and they have to re-loan and pay off in small increments.  It may take them 6 months to get out of it and by then they have lost so much money, not to mention the time and paperwork each time they go re-loan.  It is a rough situation to get caught up in.

problem|98.155.116.88|12/16/2015 5:48:13 AM|Iris Nakahara|It really is sad that a great amount of Americans are considered in poverty level with no means of saving for essentials and emergencies.  I have seen some people work very hard at 2 or 3 jobs to eke out a living and still not being able to save and unscrupulous finance companies only make it more difficult for them.  Believe that education is the most important thing and everyone needs to know the essentials of finance so we don\&#39;t end up with a great majority of homeless or near poverty level residents.  You can also give a helping hand to the less fortunate, however the people need to help themselves first by learning the basics of needs and wants.
