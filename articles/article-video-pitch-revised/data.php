		<p>President <a href='https://www.newsweek.com/topic/donald-trump'>Donald Trump</a> is set to impose sweeping tariffs on goods imported from Canada, Mexico and China on Tuesday, in a move that experts warned could end up driving up the cost of everyday goods in the U.S. and weighing on American consumers.</p>
		<p>On Monday, Trump said there was \"no room left\" for a deal that would avoid or postpone the tariffs on Canada and Mexico. The president framed the tariffs as a response to the two countries allowing fentanyl to flow through their borders into the U.S. \"at very high and unacceptable levels,\" though he admitted that \"a large percentage\" of the drugs were made in China.</p>
		<h4 style='margin-bottom: 1rem;'>Tariffs Explained</h4>
		<p>The tariffs expected to come into effect on Tuesday will add a 25 percent fee on all products coming from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10 percent on goods coming from China.</p>
		<p>China was already hit by a 10 percent tariff on February 4, to which the country retaliated by imposing its own tariffs on some U.S. products, including a 15 percent border tax on coal and liquefied natural gas products and 10 percent tariffs on crude oil, agricultural machinery and large-engine cars.</p>
		<p>Both Canada and China have promised to retaliate against the Trump administration's new tariffs, while Mexico expressed hope until Monday that a deal could be reached to avert the new fees. The tariffs are <a href='https://www.newsweek.com/warren-buffett-donald-trump-tariffs-2038741'>widely expected to start tit-for-tat trade wars with some of the U.S.â€™ biggest trade partners</a>, with American consumers being caught in the crosshairs</p>

			<h4 style='margin-bottom: 1rem;'>Why are Tariffs Affecting Toys?</h4>
			<p>About 80% of all toys in the U.S. are imported from China, <a href='https://www.toyassociation.org/PressRoom2/News/2024_News/the-toy-association-names-industry-veteran-greg-ahearn-as-new-president-and-ceo.aspx'>Greg Ahearn</a>, President and CEO of the Toy Association, explains. \"China has historically been a good trade partner with the U.S., particularly around certain industries, the toy industry being one of them.\"</p>
			<p>Some of the beautifully crafted wooden toys from beloved brands like Lovevery and Melissa & Doug are designed in the U.S. but manufactured in China. <a href='https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/childrens-products/toy-reviews/g45063957/cutest-squishmallows/'>Plush Squishmallows</a> are made in China, as are <a href='https://www.americangirldollnews.com/post/where-are-american-girl-dolls-manufactured'>American Girl dolls</a>.</p>
			<h4 style='margin-bottom: 1rem;'>Toys We Love May Face Price Increases</h4>
			<p>\"A 10% tariff on China could result in a 10% or maybe even slightly more increase in consumer prices as we head into the third and fourth quarters of 2025,\" Ahearn says.</p>
			<p>While the policy is still in the works, if you know you'll need to buy <a href='https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/childrens-products/a61827377/best-gifts-for-kids/'>kids' gifts</a> for birthdays and holidays this year, I don't think you'd regret stockpiling these now, at today's tariff-free prices.</p>
